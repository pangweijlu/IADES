Its aim is to develop a prototype framework inspired from human immune system to detect anomalous patterns from high resolution environmental sensor data of multiple sources. \r\n\r\nPrinciple Investigator: Dr. Wei Pang  (Aberdeen)\r\n\r\nCo-investigator: Prof. George M. Coghill (Aberdeen)\r\n\r\nCo-investigator: Kit Macleod (James Hutton)\r\n\r\nObjectives: \r\n1. Feasibility study of developing an immune-inspired anomaly\r\ndetection framework for environment sensor data.\r\n\r\n2. Make the anomaly detection framework ready for NLG techniques,\r\nwhich could achieve better communication of environmental\r\nanomalies.\r\n\r\n3. Investigate how to extract spatial-temporal patterns using immuneinspired\r\napproaches from environment sensor data.\r\n\r\n4. Develop a prototype model for identifying anomalies from historical\r\ndata.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
