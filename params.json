Coghill (Aberdeen)\r\nCo-investigator: Kit Macleod (James Hutton)\r\n\r\nObjectives: \r\n1. Feasibility study of developing an immune-inspired anomaly\r\ndetection framework for environment sensor data.\r\n2. Make the anomaly detection framework ready for NLG techniques,\r\nwhich could achieve better communication of environmental\r\nanomalies.\r\n3. Investigate how to extract spatial-temporal patterns using immuneinspired\r\napproaches from environment sensor data.\r\n4. Develop a prototype model for identifying anomalies from historical\r\ndata.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
