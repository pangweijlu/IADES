{"name":"IADES: Immune-inspired Anomaly Detection In Environmental Sensor Data with Natural Language Generation Support","tagline":"Funded by RCUK dot.rural Digital Economy Hub, Weather2 ltd, and Data2Text ltd","body":"\r\nIADES is a partnership project funded by RCUK dot.rural Digital Economy Hub, Weather2 ltd, and Data2Text ltd. Its aim is to develop a prototype framework inspired from human immune system to detect anomalous patterns from high resolution environmental sensor data of multiple sources. \r\n\r\n## Investigators\r\n\r\nPrinciple Investigator: Dr. Wei Pang  (Aberdeen)\r\n\r\nCo-investigator: Prof. George M. Coghill (Aberdeen)\r\n\r\nCo-investigator: Kit Macleod (James Hutton)\r\n\r\n## Project Objectives\r\n\r\n1. Feasibility study of developing an immune-inspired anomaly\r\ndetection framework for environment sensor data.\r\n\r\n2. Make the anomaly detection framework ready for NLG techniques,\r\nwhich could achieve better communication of environmental\r\nanomalies.\r\n\r\n3. Investigate how to extract spatial-temporal patterns using immuneinspired\r\napproaches from environment sensor data.\r\n\r\n4. Develop a prototype model for identifying anomalies from historical\r\ndata.\r\n\r\n##  Project Summary\r\n\r\nIn this research we aim to build a software tool to detect abnormal behaviour\r\nin the environment from measured data. This can help us predict natural\r\ndisasters (e.g. floods) and extreme weather events.\r\nThe design of this tool will be inspired by the human immune systems:\r\nsimilar to the way that the immune systems protect us from foreign invaders,\r\nthis tool can detect potential threats to the environment. To make users\r\nbetter understand the abnormal behaviour in the environment, we will make\r\nthe tool ready for future integration with natural language generation (NLG)\r\ntechniques, which can generate natural language from the output of the\r\ndetection tool.\r\n\r\nIn this project we use river levels data from SEPA (Scottish Environment\r\nProtection Agency) and hydrological and meteorological data from our\r\nindustrial partners (Data2Text Ltd and Weather2 Ltd) to test our detection\r\ntool.
